This is a resume site project, decided to deviate from a  normal top nav bar and have it on the side instead.
I'm liking the colors and the typography on the "main" text.

Don't feel like making a multi-page resume, I want to try making divs appear and disappear when the user clicks the navbar.

Turns out to be quite hard to make divs appear and disappear just using html and css, maybe I'll try to make a scrolling resume then?

-To make the "main content" scroll while the others didn't, I used position sticky  property on the fixed elements.

Quite satisfied with the design and concept, though couldn't implement some ideas due to being a pure HTML CSS project.
Maybe I'll further polish this in the future with added responsiveness and features!
